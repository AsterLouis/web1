  <a href = "https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target = "_blank" title = "html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup
  language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.<br>
  The primary use of HTML is as a final-state format for web pages made available on the Internet.<br>
  Early HTML files were often created directly in a text editor, but by the time HTML 5 was the accepted standard for web pages,
  most pages were created in visual editors like Adobe's Dreamweaver or in enterprise-level content management systems.

  Many take advantage of popular "frameworks," software toolkits developed for building web pages making extensive use of CSS, Javascript, or both. Examples are Bootstrap and AngularJS.<br>
